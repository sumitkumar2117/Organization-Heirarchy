None.

Explanation of probable O(n) time (n = no of employees in the organisation) :-
   Only in case of firing an employee who manages other employees, it would take O(k) time (where k = no of employees working previously under the fired employee)
to change the boss ids and references of each and every child node. This may lead to the worst time complexity to O(n) in case most of the [O(n)] employees
work under the employee. We can't do it in O(log n) as to delete a node, we have to remove each and every pointer refernerring to that node amd so
we must have to traverse the whole employees list one by one.

Else all other things are implemented in either O(log n) or O(1) time only.
